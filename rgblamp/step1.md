# Where are we?

### Define the Problem

The engineering design process starts when you ask the following questions about problems that you observe:
<ul>
<li>What is the need?</li>
<li>Who has the need?</li>
<li>Why is it important to satisfy the need?</li>
</ul>

### Do Background Research

Learn from the experiences of others â€” this can help you find out about existing solutions to similar problems, and avoid mistakes that were made in the past.

#### Different functions of colored light

## Light for aesthetics or decoration

<mark style="background:blue; color: white">Think</mark> Find another example of a light object which the main function is a decorative function. What would you change in order to make it more engaging for your teacher?

<mark style="background:red; color: white">Task</mark> share your story with your classmates.

# Light and health

~**Biodynamic lighting** is an artificial light source that replicates the dynamic variations of daylight and sunlight through a light management system.~

~**Chronobiology** is a field of biology that examines periodic (cyclic) phenomena in living organisms and their adaptation to solar- and lunar-related rhythms.~

<mark style="background:blue; color: white">Think</mark> What has light to do with health? How does light influence our bodies?

#### Different functions of colored light

# Light and health

~Light is one of the most important factors in healthy plant growth. Plants, unlike humans, can make their own food through a process called photosynthesis.~

~The correct color of light, along with water and nutrient soil, will provide a plant with the sustenance of life.~

### Plants prefer blue and red light

~These two color qualities have the greatest influence on how a plant grows. Blue lights' responsibility is to promote leaf and vegetable growth, while red, when combined with blue, will make a plant flower.~

#### Different functions of colored light

# Light and psychology

~**Color psychology** is the study of hues as a determinant of human behavior. Color influences perceptions that are not obvious, such as the taste of food <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_psychology">Wikipedia</a>~

***KJ: Can we we have original text here without Wikipedia link?***

~For example, colored light is used in stores to make certain products more attractive to buyers.~

***KJ: Give me examples (with images!). Blue for fish, yellow for meat? Or make it a student activity to bring photos from SPAR?***
