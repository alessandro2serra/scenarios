# Detailed design

### 1. Choose the Best Solution

Look at whether each possible solution meets your design requirements. Some solutions probably meet more requirements than others. Reject solutions that do not meet the requirements.

### 2. Develop the Solution

Development involves the refinement and improvement of a solution, and it continues throughout the design process, often even after a product ships to customers. <f-link to="https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/engineering-design-process/engineering-design-process-steps">Read more</a>

## How is color produced in devices?

The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors.
The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.

##### üéõÔ∏è Adjust the values to get the maximum brightness in the central area

<f-slider title="Red" value="64" to="255" integer set="r" />

<f-slider title="Green" value="128" to="255" integer set="g" />

<f-slider title="Blue" value="196" to="255" integer set="b" />

## How many bits are needed to represent your bit depth?

Bits|Colors|Description
---|---|---
`1`|2|Only two colors in total, usually black and white
`4`|16|Many early games were presented in this color palette
`8  `|256|8bit images are commonly used in games to save on memory for textures and sprites

## Assignment: Engineering your own RGB Lamp

Grab a piece of paper and write a high-level description of how the values of the three different channels (red, green, blue) will react to the input from the environment.

***KJ: The task is not entirely clear and image does not help***

<big>Suggestions:</big>
<ul>
<li>make a diagram or a graph showing the relationship between input and colors.</li>
