## Light and plants

Light is one of the most important factors in healthy plant growth. Plants, unlike humans, can make their own food through a process called photosynthesis.~

The correct color of light, along with water and nutrient soil, will provide a plant with the sustenance of life.

**Plants prefer blue and red light**

These two color qualities have the greatest influence on how a plant grows. Blue lights' responsibility is to promote leaf and vegetable growth, while red, when combined with blue, will make a plant flower.
