# Plastic reuse and art

### Christo ”The Floating Piers”, 2016

Plastic can also be used to make you walk on water, <a href="https://christojeanneclaude.net/projects/the-floating-piers" target="_new">see this art installation</a>.

### Discuss

What are your feelings about this installation?

After which physical laws the piers were floating, even with many people walking on them? Concentrate on these terms:

# Does your boat float?

### How much weight can you add to your object before it sinks?

1. Measure the volume of your "boat". Hint: fill it with water then pour the water into a measuring cup. The amount of water that was in the boat tells you its volume.

2. Calculate how many grams of water the boat can hold (1 ml of water = 1 g).

3. Float the empty boat and start adding quarters one at a time. Add them slowly so you don’t flip the boat over! What happens to the boat as you add quarters? How many quarters does it take to sink the boat?

4. Calculate how many grams of quarters were needed to sink the boat. One quarter of water has a mass of about 5.67 g.

5. Compare the total mass of water that sink the boat to the mass of water that fills the boat (see step 2). What do you notice?

## Finish your boat

#### Checklist:

- is it made reusing materials?

- has it any environmental purpose?

- can it float when stressed with more weight? Stressed with movements? Stressed with distortions of original shape?

#### Remember:

- Earth pollution

- raising of sea level
