# Plastic pollution

The sea is covered by "plastic floating islands"

Plastic can sink and pollute the sea at all depths

# Plastic reuse and art

### Christo ”The Floating Piers”, 2016

Plastic can also be used to make you walk on water, <a href="https://christojeanneclaude.net/projects/the-floating-piers" target="_new">see this art installation</a>.

***KJ: Could there be just 1-2 sentences about the installation?***

### Discuss

What are your feelings about this installation?

After which physical laws the piers were floating, even with many people walking on them? Concentrate on these terms:

# Make a boat from recycled plastic

-

1. Collect some plastic objects around you  

2. Find out the type of plastic they are made of

3. Design a boat or other floating structure<br><a href="https://observers.france24.com/en/20170804-tunisia-holds-world-first-sea-race-boats-made-out-recycled-materials" target="_new">See the example</a>.

4. Verify that an boat can float even if built with a plastic material that sink. What’s the reason?<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xniW3_afO-0" target="_blank">How do ships float?</a>

5. Calculate your boat weight and its buoyancy in water

# Does your boat float?

### How much weight can you add to your object before it sinks?

-

<span class="bullet">1</span> Measure the volume of your "boat". Hint: fill it with water then pour the water into a measuring cup. The amount of water that was in the boat tells you its volume.

-

<span class="bullet">2</span> Calculate how many grams of water the boat can hold (1 ml of water = 1 g).

-

<span class="bullet">3</span> Float the empty boat and start adding quarters one at a time. Add them slowly so you don’t flip the boat over! What happens to the boat as you add quarters? How many quarters does it take to sink the boat?

-

<span class="bullet">4</span> Calculate how many grams of quarters were needed to sink the boat. One quarter of water has a mass of about 5.67 g.

-

<span class="bullet">5</span> Compare the total mass of water that sink the boat to the mass of water that fills the boat (see step 2). What do you notice?

## Finish your boat

#### Checklist:

1. Is it made reusing materials?

2. Does it havea an environmental purpose?

3. Can it float when stressed with more weight? Stressed with movements? Stressed with distortions of original shape?

#### Remember:

- Earth pollution

- raising of sea level
