# Warming up... 

-
 
Let's start with a small warming-up exercise.

1. Fold a sheet of A4 paper <mark>in half</mark> <small>*(short edge to short edge)*</small> 
2. Find the <mark>center</mark> and mark it with a pen  <small>*(don't have to be TOO precise)*</small> 
3. From the <mark>closed edge</mark> cut the paper to the center point 
4. Fold the right ‘flap’ <mark>up</mark>, then back <mark>down</mark> again <small>*(to get a folding line)*</small>. Then fold the 'flap' <mark>inside</mark> itself.
5. <mark>Repeat</mark> steps 2 to 5 for each rectangle for a few times over and over again <small>*(until the rectangles become too small to cut or fold)*</small>

**Do not open the paper until you are done!**

# Nice work! 
 
Now if you fold the paper open, you probably end up with something like shown on this picture. 
 
By following the steps of cutting and folding you were performing a so called <big>**ALGORITHM**</big>.

# Computer generated algorithms


Cooking, folding a t-shirt, building a wall. These activities consist of relatively simple instructions (i.e. ‘algorithms’).

Computers also perform algorithms. More complex algorithms may require a lot of computing power - so much that normally people cannot manage it by themselves.
 
Computers and design go together well. This last decade has seen the emergence of a new way of designing that’s all about the conscious use of algorithms mixed with the computational power of computers. A lot of designers, artists and architects have been using computers and complex algorithms to create stunning work.

### A table by Stefan Bassing

Designer Stefan Bassing has used digital modelling to create a pair of tables, made from repetitive elements to simplify the production process.

> Once the furniture is created as a digital model, the role of the computer is at forefront. The computer numerically controls (CNC) the bending machine, converting steel rods into parts for use. Then, these would be assembled by a craftsperson, before being copper plated.

### 'Entangle' Wall Tiles by Lynne MacLachlan

'Entangle' is a 3D printed wall tilling system, taking inspiration from mathematical tiling principles and quantum mechanics.

> Based on the mathematical principles of Truchet tiles, two modular segments can be combined in a myriad of different ways. It is possible to create various wave patterns, knot designs, complex repeating patterns or fill space in an apparently random fashion. (McLachlan 2017).

### 'Sand Spline' - generative art by Anders Hoff

### ProtoHouse by SoftKill

Softkill Design has recently completed ProtoHouse, a prototype for the first 3D printed house, that has the same structure as human bones.

> The ProtoHouse project was developed in the Architectural Association School's Design Research Lab within the 'behavioral matter' studio of Robert Stuart-Smith. The project investigated the architectural potential of the latest Selective Laser Sintering technologies, testing the boundaries of large scale 3D printing. The designing was done with computer algorithms that micro-organize the printed material itself.

# Ok...

You might think that probably they use very expensive supercomputers plus knowledge of wizardry to make such stuff. However, with basic knowledge of coding we can demonstrate that ***even quite simple sets of rules can create quite interesting results***.

## Firstly, we have to understand the very basics of how computer algorithms work. It possesses five key aspects:

-

## **1**
### FINITENESS
The algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps.

-

## **2**
### DEFINITENESS
Each step must be precisely defined; the actions to be carried out must be rigorously and unambiguously specified for each case.

-

## **3** 
### INPUT 
An algorithm has zero or more inputs, taken from a specified set of objects.

-

## **4** 
### OUTPUT
An algorithm has one or more outputs, which have a specified relation to the inputs.

-

## **5** 
### EFFECTIVENESS
All operations to be performed must be sufficiently basic that they can be done exactly and in finite length (Knut 1997)

-

## More specifically, an algorithm is composed of:

-

## **1**
### INPUT 
you "feed" some parameters (variables) or data to your algorithm

-

## **2**
### PROCESSING 
algorithm does the computing

-

## **3**
### OUTPUT
you get a result

## Let's take a look of some simple examples

With this examples you can see how simple shapes combined and some basic operations like repeating, scaling and rotating generate a lot of complex patterns.    
When we add important properties like colour, stroke width, transparency and so on we can alter the algorithm and have a different, much more complex output.

## Just some lines

***Move the sliders*** and see what happens. Nothing too special here &ndash; our algorithm creates a grid of small lines that change when parameters change. Parameters change when you move the sliders. That's it.

-

Simple lines can get boring quite fast. Let's explore a few more complex shapes. Now let's play with a box. Boxes can get pretty cool if you make them ***overlap*** and ***rotate*** them a bit. Give it a try!

<f-slider title="Rotation"

    to="180"
    step="0.1"
    :value="0.01"
    v-on:value="i => set('rotation3', i)"

***Circles are just CRAZY!*** Remember - all we are doing here is to repeat one simple circle and adjusting its radius, but the visual output can get very complex and interenting.

## Random

-

Too much control may always not to be a good thing &mdash; sometimes you get more interesting and unexpected results if you just let things to happen. Let's allow the computer just to generate ***random*** patterns &mdash; all you have to do is to ***press the button***. 

-

<button 
    v-on:click="set( 'randomness', random(0.55, 1, true) )" class="primary"
    style="background:var(--blue)">Random generator</button>



<small v-if="get('randomness')">***HINT:*** *If the pattern sucks, press the button again - you'll get a new on*</small>

<br /><br />

<f-prev-button /> <f-next-button v-if="get('randomness')" title="Next" />

-

<f-scene  width="600" height="500">
  <f-grid-pattern :step="random(get('randomness')-0.5, get('randomness')+0.5, true)">
    <f-group> 
      <f-circle 
          :stroke-width="3"  
          :r = "random(get('randomness')-0.5, get('randomness')+1, true)"

# That was just a beginning

-

These were some very simple examples of what a basic repeating combined with some scaling and/or rotating can generate from most simple black and white geometric objects.  

-

But this is just a beginning, we didn't even touch other important properties like ***color***, ***stroke width***, ***transparency***, ***animation*** and so on.

## Now as you have the information, you will become an Algorist.  
 
Let's get back to paper and scissors we started with

-

1. Take the folded paper 
2. Try to mention the steps that are used to get the folded form 
3. Add your own steps by cutting and/or folding the paper. Be creative, take risks :) 
4. Describe your steps, to create an algorithm 
5. Have fun (:
