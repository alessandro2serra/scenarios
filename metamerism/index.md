### Experiment 1

In the example of the dress you have seen that the same
object may look differently. Some might say it is white and
gold, others see it as black and blue. But what is true?

To find out more about colors and light you are going to do
an experiment in a virtual learning environment.

Use a comuter or your smartphone (with a VR headset if
possible) and enter the first experiment.

1. Make yourself familiar with the VR environment
(moving, viewing, controls ...)

2. Experiment with the slider. Which effect does it have?

### Experiment 2

You have seen, that lighting can have an enormous effect on
the way the human eye sees colors. Our perception of colors
is affected very much by light.

The effect on the dress was already clearly visible. But there are changes which may be more subtle or more drastic.

Use a copmuter or your smartphone (with a VR headset if
possible) and enter the second experiment.

1. Use the buttons to experiment with the different effects.

2. Try different combinations and watch the consequences
on the scene and the objects.
