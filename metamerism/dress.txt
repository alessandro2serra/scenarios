The Dress

In the example of the dress you have seen that the same object may look differently.
Some might say it is white and gold, others see it as black and blue. But what is true?
To find out more about colors and light you are going to do an experiment in a virtual learning environment.
Use a computer or your smartphone (with a VR headset if possible) and enter the first experiment.

1. Make yourself familiar with the VR environment (moving, viewing, controls ...)

2. Experiment with the buttons on the table. Which effect do they have?
