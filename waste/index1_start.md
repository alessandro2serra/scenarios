| section: Bone Chair

## Bone Chair by Joris Laarman

Due to innovative digital techniques we can create **customized, smart and more complex forms**. 
Joris Laarman used topology optimization software based on the findings of professor Claus Mattheck to develop **a chair with a bone-like structure**.

| section: Chalk challenge
| 1 1 1 2

<caption>üõ†Ô∏è Hands-on activity</caption>

## Chalk challenge

1. Take a sidewalk chalk and weigh it.

2. Place it vertically and put a weight on it.

3. Use a knife, rasp or file to take some material off. **Note:** the length of the chalk must stay the same.

4. Try to leave just as much chalk as you need to keep a strong construction. Be careful that is does not break.

5. If you think you have reached the optimum‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs put the weight back on.

6. Did it break? If it doesn‚Äôt try to scrape off some more and test it again.

Use [this form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WHGHGWO3R43I0yfy42PP_W9IsvWljxmRGcs1dD0aDh8/edit) to document your results.

## Why we mimic nature?

There‚Äôs a **duality** between nature and engineering, when it comes to lightweight constructions.

* Nature survives with a **minimal use of energy**. So that means, it‚Äôs super efficient! As engineers we can learn from nature to reduce material, energy and thus costs.

* Nature has the **ability to adapt** to its changing surroundings during its life time. Think about the skin of a sea cucumber which is extremely flexible, but becomes very rigid in a blink of an eye when it‚Äôs threatened. As engineers we can learn from nature‚Äôs strategy to make more resilient structures.

## A little bit about engineering

-

~Making constructions is not only a matter of choosing the right material. It‚Äôs the combination of material, form and production process, which makes the construction light and strong.~

**~Form, material and production process is a trinity.~**

~You can imagine when it comes to lightweight constructions the balance of the trinity becomes more critical!~

  </f-group>
</f-scene>

## A little bit more about engineering

Besides the trinity (form, material and production process) the efficiency of a construction is depending on the **kind of load** the construction has to carry. 

Loads on a construction could be: bending, pressure, tension, shear, torsion, vibration‚Ä¶ etc.

When designing an object an engineer investigates all its possible loads.

## Trees & Bones

Take for instance the growth of **trees** and **bones**.

During their lifecycle both these natural structures make **optimal use of material** in dealing with stresses and loads. But in different ways.

## Trees ability to adapt

Trees **only add material where it is needed** by producing thicker tree rings at heavier loaded spots. 

e.g. When a tree is constantly exposed to wind at one side, it grows thicker at the other side.

## Bones ability to adapt

Bones also produce extra material where needed, but they are also able to **eliminate material** in less loaded spots.

## Adaptive growth

This growing and killing of material in response to mechanical forces is called **adaptive growth**.
 
An everyday (visible) example of adaptive growth is the growth of callus on the soles of feet!

## Four ways to optimize

The following four hands-on exercises introduce some useful principles in the designing and building of structures, with **minimal use of material** and therefore **maximized efficiency**.
