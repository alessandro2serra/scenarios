## Ocean Cleanup initiative

***TODO: Shorten, add stcructure***

A lot of people are aware of our footprint and are taking action in order to make the world a better place to live

At age 16 (2011), Boyan Slat came across more plastic than fish while diving in Greece. He decided to devote a high school project for deeper investigation into ocean plastic pollution and why it was considered impossible to clean up.

He later came up with the idea to build a passive system, using the circulating ocean currents to his advantage, which he presented at a TEDx talk in Delft in 2012.

https://www.theoceancleanup.com/

Have a look at his Ocean Cleanup foundation at the website.  
What do you think what is most remarkable about this project?
