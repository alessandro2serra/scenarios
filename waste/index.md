We all know that we can’t keep on wasting resources. 

We’re exhausting our planet!

**What’s your feeling about that?**

# Ocean Cleanup

***TODO: Shorten, add scructure***

A lot of people are aware of our footprint and are taking action in order to make the world a better place to live

At age 16 (2011), Boyan Slat came across more plastic than fish while diving in Greece. He decided to devote a high school project for deeper investigation into ocean plastic pollution and why it was considered impossible to clean up.

He later came up with the idea to build a passive system, using the circulating ocean currents to his advantage, which he presented at a TEDx talk in Delft in 2012.

Have a look at his Ocean Cleanup foundation at the website.  
What do you think what is most remarkable about this project?

# Choose 2 concepts and explain them

You probably found a lot of initiatives to make the world cleaner and they all have their own methodologies and concepts.

For example:

<div class="grid" style="--cols: 1fr 1fr 1fr">

<f-card background="none" border="var(--lightgray)">circular economy</f-card>

<f-card background="none" border="var(--lightgray)">upcycle, recycle, downcycle</f-card>

<f-card background="none" border="var(--lightgray)">cradle to cradle</f-card>

<f-card background="none" border="var(--lightgray)">sustainability</f-card>

<f-card  background="none" border="var(--lightgray)">urban mining</f-card>

<f-card  background="none" border="var(--lightgray)">shared economy</f-card>

</div>

Explain of the two concepts you have chosen how they contribute to make the world cleaner from waste.

# Example

<f-card background="none" border="var(--lightgray)">circular economy</f-card>

In a nutshell this animation shows the concept of circular economy.
Before you watch the animation look at the following questions.

1. What is the difference between human and nature concerning waste?

2. What is meant by linear economy?

3. Which solutions for our waste problem does this animation show us?

Share what you’ve seen with the class.
