## The FLAX Chair by Christien Meindertsma

With the Flax Chair Christien Meindertsma tried to use a **local biodegradable product** in a new contemporary way and she made sure to use the material **as economical as possible**.

## From flax to form

A new **composite material** was created **to fit in a circular system**, using four layers of an existing woven flax textile and five layers of a newly developed dry-needle felted flax. 

The soft pile of fabrics is heat pressed, melting the **flax** and **PLA** (a biodegradable plastic) into the shape of a rigid chair.

| section: Sustainable materials

## Design to disappear

In the past 20 years designers, artists and makers are looking more and more for **sustainable alternatives**. Ecology and design became an integrated practice.

As an answer to the throw-away society they choose for a **circular approach**. Their ideal is that disposable products are fully degradable or be a raw material for something new. Making degradable objects could be done with biobased material.

---

## Experiment to design

With this circular approach designers, architects, makers, scientists and craftsmen all participate in the **experimentation with materials** and are forced to work together interdisciplinary.

Their inventiveness and creativity comes possible from this opportunity of **working with hands, new techniques** and by **working interdisciplinary**.

| section: Dung as a material

## Low value material - dung

**From disgust to desire!**

By 2050 when the population exceed nine billion, feces, hair and dust are among the few natural resources which are actually increasing.

Poo is a low value natural material, and you could make functional products of it.

## Designers as material innovators 

> *~Imagine a world where biological fabrication replaces traditional manufacture, plants that grow products, and bacteria genetically re-programmed to "biofacture" new materials, artifacts, energy or medicine.~*

<small>Quote of Carole Collet at ‘Alive’ exhibition held in Paris, 2013</small>

In the years after the Alive exhibition the gap between the above mentioned **concept and reality** shrinks. 

How? Let’s have a look!

## Living materials - mycelium

<big><var>my·ce·li·um (mī-sē′lē-əm)</var></big>
~*n. pl.* my·ce·li·a (-lē-ə)~

1) The vegetative part of a fungus, consisting of a mass of branching, threadlike hyphae.

2) A similar mass of fibers formed by certain bacteria.

In other words: mycelium is a dense network of fungal threads of which mushroom sprout and of which one could make a variety of products.

## Living materials - bacteria

Susan Lee, textile designer, and David Hepworth, scientist, are pioneers of producing fabrics and clothing from bacteria-generated cellulose.

| section: Exercise: Bio-based materials

## Exercise

We talked about three examples of bio-based material. Now research your own.

1. Per person find one other bio-based material and fill in the A5 Format you find below. (You can use this in Indesign or Photoshop)

2. Safe it as a PDF file and optionally print it on thick paper and cut to A5 size. 

3. Combine all the cards to make your class library of bio-based materials.

| section: Shape and countershape

## Shape and Countershape

Remember Christien Meindertsma’s FLAX Chair? 

She made optimal use of the material **using the full sheet of cloth** to make a chair.

The principle behind this is **using shape and countershape**.

<caption>Shape and Countershape</caption>

The principle of shape and countershape is used across all art and design disciplines; graphic design, art, product design, etc. 

Let’s look at some examples.

In product design...

Here working with shape and countershape is a great way to make something and **minimize waste material** at the same time!

<caption>Shape and Countershape</caption>

Another example in product design is the **Mobilier puzzle** of Jean-Pierre Levasseur. 

It uses both shape and countershape to get a complete dollhouse interior out of one sheet of pre-cut plywood.

Of course you could apply this on a bigger scale for life-size furniture...

| section: Exercise: Shape and countershape

<caption>Shape and Countershape</caption>

## Exercise

1. Choose your discipline, 2D (think graphic design) or 3D (think product design or art) 

2. Find at least three images of examples within your discipline in which the technique of shape and countershape is being used. (10 minutes)

3. Design a 2D or 3D design using the shape and countershape technique. Make a small prototype/sketch within. (30 minutes)

| section: Folding

## Folding

To have **as little as possible waste** material, you can also use folding techniques. 

For example the **Foldaroid stool** by Anthony Yu Wei Tong.

## Folding

Or what do you think of the **Zseat** by Studio Stallinga.

| section: Cut and fold

## Cut and Fold

Another option for optimizing your material use and minimizing waste is **using a combination of cuts and folds**.

A perfect example is the **Pop-up Lamp** by the French studio Well Well Designers is. It’s constructed from one sheet of paper with a special coating.

<caption>Cut and Fold</caption>

Zev Bianchi and Bcompact design used a fancier version of cutting and folding called **kerf bending** to make the **Aviator Chair** out of one sheet of plywood. To the right you see there prototypes in paper.

## Design assignment

-

You have practiced with different ways and techniques to minimize waste when designing a new product. 

Design a usable object using one of the techniques (shape and countershape folding, cut and fold). 

Do this by following the steps on the next slide. 

-

Key steps

1. Choose your material and look at the dimensions of the material. 

2. Make at least three 2D sketches. Keep in mind that you cannot have waste material. For example if you use a sheet of hardboard take the standard size to work with. (You can also make your design in such a way that you can make multiple out of one sheet.)

3. Choose one of or combine your 2D sketches and make a 3D sketch model of it. 

4. Evaluate your model, add or adjust where needed.  

5. Make your final object.
