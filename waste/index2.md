# The FLAX Chair by Christien Meindertsma

With the Flax Chair Christien Meindertsma tried to use a **local biodegradable product** in a new contemporary way and she made sure to use the material **as economical as possible**. 

> **Tip:** Use English subtitles on video

# From flax to form

A new **composite material** was created **to fit in a circular system**, using four layers of an existing woven flax textile and five layers of a newly developed dry-needle felted flax. 

The soft pile of fabrics is heat pressed, melting the **flax** and **PLA** (a biodegradable plastic) into the shape of a rigid chair.

# Design to disappear

In the past 20 years designers, artists and makers are looking more and more for **sustainable alternatives**. Ecology and design became an integrated practice.

As an answer to the throw-away society they choose for a **circular approach**. Their ideal is that disposable products are fully degradable or be a raw material for something new. Making degradable objects could be done with biobased material.

# Low value material - dung

# Designers as material innovators

# Exercise

We talked about three examples of bio-based material. Now research your own.

Step 1. Per person find one other bio-based material and fill in the A5 Format you find below. (You can use this in Indesign or Photoshop)

Step 2. Safe it as a PDF file and optionally print it on thick paper and cut to A5 size. 

Step 3. Combine all the cards to make your class library of bio-based materials.

# Shape and Countershape

Another example in product design is the Mobilier puzzle of Jean-Pierre Levasseur. 

It uses both shape and countershape to get a complete dollhouse interior out of one sheet of pre-cut plywood.

Of course you could apply this on a bigger scale for life-size furniture...

# Shape and Countershape

## Exercise

Step 1.  Choose your discipline, 2D (think graphic design) or 3D (think product design or art) 
Step 2. Find at least three images of examples within your discipline in which the technique of shape and countershape is being used. (10 minutes)
Step 3. Design a 2D or 3D design using the shape and countershape technique. Make a small prototype/sketch within. (30 minutes)

# Design assignment

-

You have practised with different ways and techniques to minimize waste when designing a new product. 

Design a usable object using one of the techniques (shape and countershape, folding, cut and fold). 

Do this by following the steps on the next slide. 

-

Key steps

1. Choose your material and look at the dimensions of the material. 

2. Make at least three 2D sketches. Keep in mind that you cannot have waste material. For example if you use a sheet of hardboard take the standard size to work with. (You can also make your design in such a way that you can make multiple out of one sheet.)

3. Choose one of or combine your 2D sketches and make a 3D sketch model of it. 

4. Evaluate your model, add or adjust where needed.  

5. Make your final object.
