## Ocean Cleanup initiative

***TODO: Shorten, add stcructure***

A lot of people are aware of our footprint and are taking action in order to make the world a better place to live

At age 16 (2011), Boyan Slat came across more plastic than fish while diving in Greece. He decided to devote a high school project for deeper investigation into ocean plastic pollution and why it was considered impossible to clean up.

He later came up with the idea to build a passive system, using the circulating ocean currents to his advantage, which he presented at a TEDx talk in Delft in 2012.

https://www.theoceancleanup.com/

Have a look at his Ocean Cleanup foundation at the website.  
What do you think what is most remarkable about this project?

## Choose 2 concepts and explain them

You probably found a lot of initiatives to make the world cleaner and they all have their own methodologies and concepts.

For example:

<div class="grid" style="--cols: 1fr 1fr 1fr">

<f-card background="none" border="var(--lightgray)">circular economy</f-card>

<f-card background="none" border="var(--lightgray)">upcycle, recycle, downcycle</f-card>

<f-card background="none" border="var(--lightgray)">cradle to cradle</f-card>

<f-card background="none" border="var(--lightgray)">sustainability</f-card>

<f-card  background="none" border="var(--lightgray)">urban mining</f-card>

<f-card  background="none" border="var(--lightgray)">shared economy</f-card>

</div>

Explain of the two concepts you have chosen how they contribute to make the world cleaner from waste.

## Example

<f-card background="none" border="var(--lightgray)">circular economy</f-card>

In a nutshell this animation shows the concept of circular economy.
Before you watch the animation look at the following questions.

1. What is the difference between human and nature concerning waste?

2. What is meant by linear economy?

3. Which solutions for our waste problem does this animation show us?

Share what you‚Äôve seen with the class.

## Chalk challenge

1. Take a sidewalk chalk and weigh it.

2. Place it vertically and put a weight on it.

3. Use a knife, rasp or file to take some material off. **Note:** the length of the chalk must stay the same.

4. Try to leave just as much chalk as you need to keep a strong construction. Be careful that is does not break.

5. If you think you have reached the optimum‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs put the weight back on.

6. Did it break? If it doesn‚Äôt try to scrape off some more and test it again.

Use [this form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WHGHGWO3R43I0yfy42PP_W9IsvWljxmRGcs1dD0aDh8/edit) to document your results.

## Why we mimic nature?

There‚Äôs a **duality** between nature and engineering, when it comes to lightweight constructions.

* Nature survives with a **minimal use of energy**. So that means, it‚Äôs super efficient! As engineers we can learn from nature to reduce material, energy and thus costs.

* Nature has the **ability to adapt** to its changing surroundings during its life time. Think about the skin of a sea cucumber which is extremely flexible, but becomes very rigid in a blink of an eye when it‚Äôs threatened. As engineers we can learn from nature‚Äôs strategy to make more resilient structures.

## A little bit about engineering

-

~Making constructions is not only a matter of choosing the right material. It‚Äôs the combination of material, form and production process, which makes the construction light and strong.~

**~Form, material and production process is a trinity.~**

~You can imagine when it comes to lightweight constructions the balance of the trinity becomes more critical!~

-

<f-scene width="300" height="400">
  <f-group v-for="(a,i) in [0 + 180,120 + 180,240 + 180]">
    <f-circle :x="polarx(a, 1)" :y="polary(a,1)" r="1.1" fill="hsla(200,25%,75%,0.5)" />
    <f-text :x="polarx(a, 1)" :y="polary(a,1)"> {{ ['form','material','production'][i] }} </f-text>
  </f-group>
</f-scene>

---

## A little bit more about engineering

Besides the trinity (form, material and production process) the efficiency of a construction is depending on the **kind of load** the construction has to carry. 

Loads on a construction could be: bending, pressure, tension, shear, torsion, vibration‚Ä¶ etc.

When designing an object an engineer investigates all its possible loads. 

---

## Trees & Bones

Take for instance the growth of **trees** and **bones**.

During their lifecycle both these natural structures make **optimal use of material** in dealing with stresses and loads. But in different ways.

## Trees ability to adapt

Trees **only add material where it is needed** by producing thicker tree rings at heavier loaded spots. 

e.g. When a tree is constantly exposed to wind at one side, it grows thicker at the other side.

## Optimization with folds

### Palm trees

Palm Trees have very clever leaves. In nice weather the leaves spread out to catch the sunlight, but during storms they fold up. The folding makes the leaves compact and thus stronger and more resistant to these circumstances.

<caption>Optimization with cells</caption>

## Exercise: Make a beeboard

Honeycombs can be found in a vast variety of structures. Especially it‚Äôs used as core infill for composite sandwiches used in aerospace structures or your everyday kitchen door. Honeycombs are hexagonal-shaped cells.

It‚Äôs lightweight and when it‚Äôs pressed into a mould, it adapt to its form. 

Beeboard you‚Äôll find in your everyday kitchen cabinet door.

> #### What you will need
* Two sheets of paper format A3, if you use thicker paper you probably need a ruler and a cutter to etch the lines first
* Pencil
* Double-sided tape
* Cutter

---

<caption>Optimization with cells</caption>

## Exercise 1: the steps

<img src="./images/bee1.jpg">

<p />

There are many ways to cut and etch paper. A laser cutter would probably be the fastest and most precise way to do it. But etching the paper with a ruler and cutter is fine too. First of all print the pattern in attachment.

<img src="./images/bee2.jpg">

***TODO: Fix steps***

1. Fold your sheets as seen in the illustration above. The blue lines must be folded inwards. The red lines must be folded outwards. When done, you‚Äôll see the half of the honeycomb shape.

<img src="./images/bee3.jpg">

<img src="./images/bee4.jpg">

2. Tape the ‚Äòhills‚Äô with double-sided tape. Than, put the other sheet on top of it, so you‚Äôll have long honeycomb shape cylinders.

<img src="./images/bee5.jpg">

3. Cut the taped sheets into shorter parts. Tape those shorter part on top of each other. 

  <img src="./images/bee6.jpg">

4. Stretch the parts, so the honeycomb beeboard will appear.

  <img src="./images/bee7.jpg">

<caption>Optimization with cells</caption>

## Exercise 2: Soap bubbles

The 3D version of a honeycomb you get when you stack balls in a crate and put weight on them, causing the walls to be pressed to each other. 

The physicist Kelvin proposed that a 14-faced polyhedron or <var>tetrakaidecahedron</var> can be considered the most ideal form to spread the forces exposed to it.

Imagine the balls are soap bubbles, they even start to share the walls!

<f-notes title="TODO: NOTES FOR A TOOL" width="50vw">

<caption>Optimization with cells</caption>

When you look at soap bubbles, you see they‚Äôre not regular; they vary in size and shape. 

This depends on the external forces, but also on the material properties of the bubble itself, like surface tension, viscosity or the competitive growth of the bubbles due to the air or gas.

<caption>Optimization with cells</caption>

~Georgy Voronoi was a Russian mathematician. A Voronoi diagram is built out of various polygons. Imagine you‚Äôre are in region and you‚Äôre looking for the closest hospital. The region is divided in areas (polygons) with nodes. Every node represents a hospital.~

~**At any point in the polygon you‚Äôre closer to the node it contains than to any other node in the whole region.**~

~And, at any point along the boundaries of the polygons, you are at the same distance from at least two nodes. This makes these diagrams very useful for many applications such as mapping and zoning, for example to find the nearest hospital.~

When you cut a thigh bone you‚Äôll see a foam structure that is optimally formed by the forces it has to carry. So, bone is strong and light. 

And: like foam bone could eliminate material by adapting to the change of the environment, but of course not at the same speed soap bubbles do!

<caption>Optimization by deformation</caption>

Last but not least: deformation can be seen as a kind of **shape optimization**.

Let‚Äôs go back to the rubber plates and sheets of  aluminum foil of Prof. Dr. Mattheck.

The way these (isotropic) **materials** bend, fold, stretch and twist can be seen as an effective adaptation to loads.

<caption>Optimization by deformation</caption>

### Example 1

Holes and notches in a piece of rubber under stress deform in such a way that local concentrations of stresses are reduced and loads are distributed evenly.

The shapes that "occur" in this way are to be found all over in the natural and manmade world!

## Example 2

The way aluminum foil deforms (and eventually tears) under tension tells us a lot about **lines of compression and tension**.

Here too, deformation offers us clues about the optimal shape given a particular load.

<caption>Optimization by deformation</caption>

The shape of components under stress can be used as a **template** for a new design that‚Äôs better suited for a particular load.

Basic idea:

* Apply force and observe the  deformation.

* Use the deformation as the basis of a manufactured form.

Again... listen to the trees!

## Exercise

1. Take a sponge and a piece of chamois cloth (‚Äòshammy‚Äô).

2. Push, pull, bend, twist and/or tear them any way you want. 

3. Observe the deformations closely and try to understand the loads and stresses that led to these shapes.

4. Use the **three** shapes that appeal to you most, or in which you sense some technical use.

5. Make a quick sketch of a product that utilizes these shapes.

| 1 2 2

## The FLAX Chair by Christien Meindertsma

With the Flax Chair Christien Meindertsma tried to use a **local biodegradable product** in a new contemporary way and she made sure to use the material **as economical as possible**. 

-

<f-video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb7zJCavMJ0" />

---

## From flax to form

A new **composite material** was created **to fit in a circular system**, using four layers of an existing woven flax textile and five layers of a newly developed dry-needle felted flax. 

The soft pile of fabrics is heat pressed, melting the **flax** and **PLA** (a biodegradable plastic) into the shape of a rigid chair.

| section: Sustainable materials

## Design to disappear

In the past 20 years designers, artists and makers are looking more and more for **sustainable alternatives**. Ecology and design became an integrated practice.

As an answer to the throw-away society they choose for a **circular approach**. Their ideal is that disposable products are fully degradable or be a raw material for something new. Making degradable objects could be done with biobased material.

---

## Experiment to design

With this circular approach designers, architects, makers, scientists and craftsmen all participate in the **experimentation with materials** and are forced to work together interdisciplinary.

Their inventiveness and creativity comes possible from this opportunity of **working with hands, new techniques** and by **working interdisciplinary**.

## Low value material - dung

**From disgust to desire!**

By 2050 when the population exceed nine billion, feces, hair and dust are among the few natural resources which are actually increasing.

Poo is a low value natural material, and you could make functional products of it.

## Designers as material innovators 

> *~Imagine a world where biological fabrication replaces traditional manufacture, plants that grow products, and bacteria genetically re-programmed to "biofacture" new materials, artifacts, energy or medicine.~*

<small>Quote of Carole Collet at ‚ÄòAlive‚Äô exhibition held in Paris, 2013</small>

In the years after the Alive exhibition the gap between the above mentioned **concept and reality** shrinks. 

How? Let‚Äôs have a look!

1) The vegetative part of a fungus, consisting of a mass of branching, threadlike hyphae.

2) A similar mass of fibers formed by certain bacteria.

In other words: mycelium is a dense network of fungal threads of which mushroom sprout and of which one could make a variety of products.

| section: Shape and countershape

## Shape and Countershape

Remember Christien Meindertsma‚Äôs FLAX Chair? 

She made optimal use of the material **using the full sheet of cloth** to make a chair.

The principle behind this is **using shape and countershape**.

<caption>Shape and Countershape</caption>

The principle of shape and countershape is used across all art and design disciplines; graphic design, art, product design, etc. 

Let‚Äôs look at some examples.

<caption>Shape and Countershape</caption>

Another example in product design is the **Mobilier puzzle** of Jean-Pierre Levasseur. 

It uses both shape and countershape to get a complete dollhouse interior out of one sheet of pre-cut plywood.

Of course you could apply this on a bigger scale for life-size furniture...

## Cut and Fold

Another option for optimizing your material use and minimizing waste is **using a combination of cuts and folds**.

A perfect example is the **Pop-up Lamp** by the French studio Well Well Designers is. It‚Äôs constructed from one sheet of paper with a special coating.

## Design assignment

-

You have practiced with different ways and techniques to minimize waste when designing a new product. 

Design a usable object using one of the techniques (shape and countershape folding, cut and fold). 

Do this by following the steps on the next slide. 

-

Key steps

1. Choose your material and look at the dimensions of the material. 

2. Make at least three 2D sketches. Keep in mind that you cannot have waste material. For example if you use a sheet of hardboard take the standard size to work with. (You can also make your design in such a way that you can make multiple out of one sheet.)

3. Choose one of or combine your 2D sketches and make a 3D sketch model of it. 

4. Evaluate your model, add or adjust where needed.  

5. Make your final object.
