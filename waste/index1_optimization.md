## Palms and shells

-

#### Palmtree leaves

Palm trees have very clever leaves. In nice weather the leaves spread out to catch the sunlight, but during storms they fold up. The folding makes the leaves compact and thus stronger and more resistant to these circumstances.

-

#### Sea shells

Shells are designed with the purpose of carrying external loads efficiently.
The folds help the thin layered shells to be resistant to predators and rough circumstances.

## Adding strenght

So now we have looked at nature and we understand that through folding materials you can **add strength** to them.

By folding the edges of the metal top of the Pallas table Konstantin Grcic added strength to it.

Honeycombs can be found in a vast variety of structures. Especially it‚Äôs used as core infill for composite sandwiches used in aerospace structures or your everyday kitchen door. Honeycombs are hexagonal-shaped cells.

It‚Äôs lightweight and when it‚Äôs pressed into a mould, it adapt to its form. 

Beeboard you‚Äôll find in your everyday kitchen cabinet door.

* Two sheets of paper format A3, if you use thicker paper you probably need a ruler and a cutter to etch the lines first

## Exercise 2: Soap bubbles

The 3D version of a honeycomb you get when you stack balls in a crate and put weight on them, causing the walls to be pressed to each other. 

The physicist Kelvin proposed that a 14-faced polyhedron or <var>tetrakaidecahedron</var> can be considered the most ideal form to spread the forces exposed to it.

Imagine the balls are soap bubbles, they even start to share the walls!

---

<caption>Optimization with cells</caption>

When you look at soap bubbles, you see they‚Äôre not regular; they vary in size and shape. 

This depends on the external forces, but also on the material properties of the bubble itself, like surface tension, viscosity or the competitive growth of the bubbles due to the air or gas.

Researching the Voronoi diagram

Let‚Äôs see if we can mimic dried clay and soap bubbles and modify them into possible emergency plans!

***TODO*** layout

<caption>Optimization with cells</caption>

Georgy Voronoi was a Russian mathematician. A Voronoi diagram is built out of various polygons. Imagine you‚Äôre are in region and you‚Äôre looking for the closest hospital. The region is divided in areas (polygons) with nodes. Every node represents a hospital.

**At any point in the polygon you‚Äôre closer to the node it contains than to any other node in the whole region.**

And, at any point along the boundaries of the polygons, you are at the same distance from at least two nodes. This makes these diagrams very useful for many applications such as mapping and zoning, for example to find the nearest hospital.

## Back to the bone

When you cut a thigh bone you‚Äôll see a foam structure that is optimally formed by the forces it has to carry. So, bone is strong and light. 

And: like foam bone could eliminate material by adapting to the change of the environment, but of course not at the same speed soap bubbles do!

## Deformation

The <var>deformation</var> (and even <var>failure</var>) of existing materials and structures under load can be very instructive for the designing and building of new ones.

First of all, deformation teaches us about fundamental loads and stresses.

Prof. Dr. Claus Mattheck uses rubber plates and sheets of aluminum foil to help you visualize loads and stresses in structures.

Last but not least: deformation can be seen as a kind of <var>shape optimization</var>.

Let‚Äôs go back to the rubber plates and sheets of  aluminum foil of Prof. Dr. Mattheck.

The way these (isotropic) **materials** bend, fold, stretch and twist can be seen as an effective adaptation to loads.

## Shapes under stress

Holes and notches in a piece of rubber under stress deform in such a way that local concentrations of stresses are reduced and loads are distributed evenly.

The shapes that "occur" in this way are to be found all over in the natural and manmade world!

1. Take a sponge and a piece of chamois cloth (‚Äòshammy‚Äô).

2. Push, pull, bend, twist and/or tear them any way you want. 

3. Observe the deformations closely and try to understand the loads and stresses that led to these shapes.

4. Use the **three** shapes that appeal to you most, or in which you sense some technical use.

5. Make a quick sketch of a product that utilizes these shapes.
