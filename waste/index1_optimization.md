## Optimization with folds

### Palm trees

Palm Trees have very clever leaves. In nice weather the leaves spread out to catch the sunlight, but during storms they fold up. The folding makes the leaves compact and thus stronger and more resistant to these circumstances.

### Shells

Shells are designed with the purpose of carrying external loads efficiently.
The folds help the thin layered shells to be resistant to predators and rough circumstances.

<caption>Optimization with folds</caption>

So now we have looked at nature and we understand that through folding materials you can **add strength** to them.

By folding the edges of the metal top of the Pallas table Konstantin Krcic added strength to it.

## Optimization with sticks and strings

### Tension and compression

Useful and efficient structures can be built using **only tension** or **only compression**.

Simple suspension bridges are examples of **tensile structures**.

Arch bridges are examples of **compressive structures**.

# Optimization with cells

## Hexagon for energy optimization

A hexagon is a form we see everywhere in nature when energy optimization is needed. 

For example in a honeycomb, radiolaria or dried clay.

---

| section: Exercise: make a beeboard

## Exercise: Make a beeboard

Hexagons can also be found in a vast variety of man-made materials.
For example, core infill for composite sandwiches used in aerospace structures. 

It’s lightweight and when it’s pressed into a mould, it adapt to its form. 

Beeboard you’ll find in your everyday kitchen cabinet door.

> #### What you will need
* Two sheets of paper format A3, if you use thicker paper you probably need a ruler and a cutter to etch the lines first
* Pencil
* Double-sided tape
* Cutter

---

<section>Optimization with cells</section>

## Exercise 1: the steps

There are many ways to cut and etch paper. A laser cutter would probably be the fastest and most precise way to do it. But etching the paper with a ruler and cutter is fine too. First of all print the pattern in attachment.

1.  Fold your sheets as seen in the illustration below. The blue lines must be folded inwards. The red lines must be folded outwards. When done, you’ll see the half of the honeycomb shape.

2.  Tape the ‘hills’ with double-sided tape. Than, put the other sheet on top of it, so you’ll have long honeycomb shape cylinders.

3. Cut the taped sheets into shorter parts. Tape those shorter part on top of each other. 

4. Stretch the parts, so the honeycomb beeboard will appear.

<section>Optimization with cells</section>

## Exercise 2: Soap bubbles

The 3D version of a honeycomb you get when you stack balls in a crate and put weight on them, causing the walls to be pressed to each other. 

The physicist Kelvin proposed that a 14-faced polyhedron (tetrakaidecahedron) can be considered the most ideal form to spread the forces exposed to it.

Imagine the balls are soap bubbles, they even start to share the walls!

## Voronoi / Soap bubbles

Furthermore, we were talking about a voronoi simulator. In principle the students will draw their own on paper. To understand what’s really happening.

But I found this simulator online: http://alexbeutel.com/webgl/voronoi.html which is movin

## Soap bubbles and Voronoi
-

When you look at soap bubbles, you see they’re not regular; they vary in size and shape. 

This depends on the external forces, but also on the material properties of the bubble itself, like surface tension, viscosity or the competitive growth of the bubbles due to the air or gas. 

-

Researching the Voronoi diagram

Let’s see if we can mimic dried clay and soap bubbles and modify them into possible emergency plans!

## Optimization with cells

~Georgy Voronoi was a Russian mathematician. A Voronoi diagram is built out of various polygons. Imagine you’re are in region and you’re looking for the closest hospital. The region is divided in areas (polygons) with nodes. Every node represents a hospital.~

~**At any point in the polygon you’re closer to the node it contains than to any other node in the whole region.**~

~And, at any point along the boundaries of the polygons, you are at the same distance from at least two nodes. This makes these diagrams very useful for many applications such as mapping and zoning, for example to find the nearest hospital.~

## Optimization with cells

### Back to the bone!

When you cut a thigh bone you’ll see a foam structure that is optimally formed by the forces it has to carry. So, bone is strong and light. 

And: like foam bone could eliminate material by adapting to the change of the environment, but of course not at the same speed soap bubbles do!

## Optimization by deformation

The deformation (and even failure) of existing materials and structures under load can be very instructive for the designing and building of new ones.

-

First of all, deformation teaches us about fundamental loads and stresses.

Prof. Dr. Claus Mattheck uses rubber plates and sheets of aluminum foil to help you visualize loads and stresses in structures.

* A black square with (the suggestion) of a frame made out of four wooden struts that can hinge (see below)

* With 1 or more holes

* A slight 3D/axonometric view also possible (object turned a little relative to the camera)

#### Animation/interaction

* Sheet and hole(s) are responding to applied forces making visible the effect and direction of compression, tension, shear and bending

## Optimization by deformation

Last but not least:
deformation can be seen as a kind of **shape optimization**.

Let’s go back to the rubber plates and sheets of  aluminum foil of Prof. Dr. Mattheck.

The way these (isotropic) **materials** bend, fold, stretch and twist can be seen as an effective adaptation to loads.

-

## Optimization by deformation

## Example 1

Holes and notches in a piece of rubber under stress deform in such a way that local concentrations of stresses are reduced and loads are distributed evenly.
The shapes that ‘occur’ in this way are to be found all over in the natural and manmade world!

## Optimization by deformation

## Example 2

The way aluminum foil deforms (and eventually tears) under tension tells us a lot about lines of **compression and tension**.

Here too, deformation offers us clues about the optimal shape given a particular load.
 
-

---

The shape of components under stress can be used as a **template** for a new design that’s better suited for a particular load.

Basic idea:

* Apply force and observe the  deformation.

* Use the deformation as the basis of a manufactured form.

Again … listen to the trees!

## Exercise

**IMAGE**

1. Take a sponge and a piece of chamois cloth (‘shammy’).

2. Push, pull, bend, twist and/or tear them any way you want. 

3. Observe the deformations closely and try to understand the loads and stresses that led to these shapes.

4. Use the three shapes that appeal to you most, or in which you sense some technical use.

5. Make a quick sketch of a product that utilizes these shapes.
