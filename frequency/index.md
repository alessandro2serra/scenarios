#### Teacher notes

This lesson is divided into three main sections:

1. Hands-on activity with the turntable to explore the meaning of frequency and movement.

2. Virtual learning objects to elaborate and test how frame rate affects our perception of movement and how frequency can be presented as a form of sinusoidal wave.

3. Creative work to combine art and motion on a turntable.
