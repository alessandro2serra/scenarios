### Learning Goals

Students learn to define <var style="color: var(--blue)">frequency</var> and <var style="color: var(--blue)">motion</var> <var style="color: var(--gray)">philosophically</var> and <var style="color: var(--gray)">technologically</var> by <var style="color: var(--gray)">hands-on</var> tasks such as creating a simple <var style="color: var(--blue)">analogue animation </var> with the help of the turntable. 

### Motivation

>Technology is advancing rapidly and teaching methods are evolving towards digitization. However, the world out of screen resolution limits shouldn't be left unexplored, which brought me up with an idea to combine tangible real-life experience with digital learning objects. The main goal of the project is driven by hands-on creative tasks which intrigue students to raise questions and find answers. I hope this project proves that building bridges between technology and art helps students to achieve their learning goals beyond their expectations. <br>
