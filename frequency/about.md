### About

In this project, students will create a simple <var style="color: var(--gray)">analogue animation</var> with the help of the turntable. This <var style="color: var(--gray)">hands-on</var> creative task is the core of the project, helping to define the <var style="color: var(--gray)">frequency</var> and <var style="color: var(--gray)">motion</var> philosophically and technologically.

### Reason of the project

>It's clear that as technology is advancing rapidly, teaching and its methods are evolving towards digitization. Thus, it's not all negative by itself, I decided to create a project, which lets students creativeness explore the world out of screen resolution limits. The main goal of the project is driven by creative tasks which intrigue students to raise questions and find answers. <br>
