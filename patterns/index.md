## Orientation on patterns

In order to find inspiration in making your own 2D textures and 3D structures, you will have to be able to recognize, find and order them. 

Next you will find some questions and accompanying tasks to help you.

## Orientation on patterns

### Exercise 1

Answers these question and find some inspirational images to stimulate your brain:

1. How do you **define** a pattern?

2. How would you **describe** a pattern?

3. Find at least three **meaningful examples** of patterns from 
your daily life. Take pictures of them, make sketches, etc.

4. Find at least three patterns **from other cultures**.

5. And at last: what pattern **defines you**? Think about your daily habits...

## Orientation on patterns

### Exercise 2

This is how you can experiment with making patterns:

* Use LEGO®

* Use Tangram puzzles

* Find similar leaves, stones, flowers, packaging, emoji, … etc.

* Use the Adobe Capture app https://www.adobe.com/products/capture.html

* Investigate the world of tessellations

  * with paper cutting http://tessellations.org/methods-diy-papercut.shtml
  
  * this online interactive tool http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/activities/Tessellate/

  * or the Amaziograph https://amaziograph.com/education.html app.

## Textures & structures

A pattern is made when a shape is copied repeatedly. 

The definition of <var>texture</var> we use when it’s a 2D surface where the pattern is only repeated in X and Y axes. 

The definition of <var>structure</var> we use for 3D patterns were the Z-axe gets in, for example with LEGO® or in Minecraft. 

Be sure to keep in mind that **repetition is key** at all times!
