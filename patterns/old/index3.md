## Textures & structures

### Exercise 1

In this stage you will make a 2D pattern / texture using only the X and Y axes. You can try to make transformations with a ruler and compass or digitally:

* **Describe the grid** that was used with the patterns you found in the orientation exercises.

* **Generate a flat surface tessellation** with a pattern that describes you, by hand or with a digital tool.

## Textures & structures

### Exercise 2

Now letâ€™s share all the findings!

1. Make a moodboard or poster to show others the examples of 2D & 3D pattern designs that have inspired your ideas and findings.

2. Explain during group discussions the ideas and constructions on your moodboard / poster. 

3. Give each other feedback on the work.

## Production method

Depending on the production method you will choose, some materials are more suitable than others.

New techniques are useful for experimenting with material and integrating <var>sequences</var> (series) or <var>algorithms</var>(arithmetic methods) in your design.

## Translation

History shows that 2D patterns are translated to 3D as well. Sometimes in a very strict order and relation, like in The Bossche School. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bossche_School

The famous Le Corbusier invented a language in architecture, where 2D has been translated into 3D. http://papers.cumincad.org/data/works/att/3642.content.pdf

| section: The fourth dimension

## The fourth dimension: time

### Exercise

Another addition to designing patterns could be the fourth dimension: time. This can be achieved with **light** (moving shadows alter the 3D view as well), **rhythm** (tapping to a song is a pattern...), **nature**, etc. 

* Even rituals, social habits and cultures show a wide range of patterns. Can you name a few examples of these kind of patterns?

* Go explore the adding of 4D to your patterns. 

* What could be the changes to your designs? How do you sense it?

* What would be the purpose for your pattern? Can you explain why?

## Final assignment

Key steps

1. Now that you improved your knowledge and skills, find a way to produce your pattern, texture or structure. You can use stamp, stencil, cut out vinyl, 3D printers, laser cutters, AR/VR... Get your skates on!

2. When you think you're done with making your best 2D/3D pattern, find at least two students to get peer reviews. You will need them in the next stage to make improvements to the design.

## Evaluation of your pattern skills 

After having worked with this scenario, your pattern skills have grown. Describe here what you have learned, for instance using these questions:

* How was your skills level on patterns before you started this scenario?

* What was your main goal with this exercise?

* In what step did you struggle the most?

* What have you learned doing this scenario?

* Will you see more patterns in your daily life from now on?
