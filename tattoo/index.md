-

<big><span class="bullet">2</span>Take a pen and paper. One of you writes than words that a designer might use to talk about tattoos. The other one writes down words that a scientist might use. Tap these images to your partners back. See if you can guess the words.</big>

-

<big><span class="bullet">3</span>Discuss with a pair: what kind of concepts are easy to “guess” from limited information</big>

# What is smart tattoo?

-

~Tattoos have been around since ancient times.~

~They are done by punctuating the skin with a needle that injects ink under the skin.~

~Now MIT-research group has suggested that some inks can be used to create smart tattoo’s that provide useful information for example about hydration, sugar and pH-levels.~

-

~The MIT-researchers used inks that functioned as indicators.~

~Indicators are chemical substances that change color according to changes in surrounding chemical concentrations.~

~In order to design a smart tattoo you need to figure out what type of biological substance you want to observe!~
