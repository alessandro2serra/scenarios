# What is smart tattoo?

~Tattoos have been around since ancient times.~

~They are done by punctuating the skin with a needle that injects ink under the skin.~

~Now MIT-research group has suggested that some inks can be used to create smart tattoo‚Äôs that provide useful information about **hydration, sugar and pH-levels**.~

<big>Work in a pair and design a "smart" tattoo<big>

## What to measure? 
The MIT-researchers used inks that functioned as indicators. 
Indicators are substances that provide useful information about their environment.
For example, information about acids and bases.

# Acids and bases

<div style="padding: 0 var(--content-padding);">

The acids and bases can be understood through the concentration of hydrogen-ion <f-math inline blue>(H+)</f-math> in a solution.

The acid level is measured with pH-scale (pH originally comes from the power of hydrogen).

pH-scale governed by the equation <f-math inline>pH = -log[H+]</f-math>

&nbsp;

<f-slider set="ph" :value=7 :to=14 integer title="ph: "  />

&nbsp;

*Move the bar to explore the pH-scale. Talk with a friend: What is the pH-range that you would need to consider with tattoos?*

# Design a smart tattoo

-

<big><span class="bullet">1</span> Discuss with your pair what substances exist in human body and how do these influence human health.</big>

-

<big><span class="bullet">2</span> Choose which one you want to measure and why.</big>

-

<big><span class="bullet">3</span> When you have decided open a paint and draw a quick black and white icon of what you want to measure.   

Visit the icon designer to learn more about icons and make adjustments to your icon if necessary.</big>

# Test your design

-

<big><span class="bullet">1</span> There are biological and chemical factors that you might want to take into account in your smart tattoo design.</big>

-

<big><span class="bullet">2</span> Compare the word lists you wrote  earlier and tape them into each other. Think and draw the possible connections between these words.</big>

-

<big><span class="bullet">3</span> Test your design in smart tattoo simulator to explore further connections. Write these down as well.</big>
