## What is a smart tattoo?

Tattoos have been around since ancient times.

They are done by punctuating the skin with a needle that injects ink under the skin.

Now MIT-research group has suggested that some inks can be used to create smart tattoo‚Äôs that provide useful information about **hydration, sugar and pH-levels**.

## Warming up

Tattooing is all about drawing images on the skin. These images are not always easy to recognize

1. Find a partner

2. Select a concept and "tattoo" it to your partner‚Äôs back by gently tapping with a finger

3. Try to guess the concept tattooed in your/your partner's back

4. Discuss: what kind of concepts are easy to ‚Äúguess‚Äù from limited information

## What to measure?

The MIT-researchers used inks that functioned as indicators.
Indicators are substances that provide useful information about their environment.
For example, information about acids and bases.

# Acids and bases

</div>

-

<div style="padding: 0 var(--content-padding);">

The acids and bases can be understood through the concentration of hydrogen-ion <f-math inline blue>(H+)</f-math> in a solution.

The acid level is measured with pH-scale (pH originally comes from the power of hydrogen).

pH-scale governed by the equation <f-math inline>pH = -log[H+]</f-math>

<f-slider set="ph" :value=7 :to=14 integer title="ph: " style="padding: calc(var(--content-padding)/2) 0" />

_Move the bar to explore the pH-scale. Talk with a friend: What is the pH-range that you would need to consider with tattoos?_

## Life or death?

How can you make sure that others understand what your tattoo is about?

Try to visualise some abstract phenomena, like life (or death), by sketching something on a piece of paper.

After you've finished, show your creation to others, or draw it on a whiteboard.

What did you draw, and why? Does it differ from your friend's drawings?
Why do we use these particular things to mean something, can everyone understand them the same way everywhere else, in all situations?

## What are we talking about?

The study of how we describe meaning to something is called **semiotics**. The main subject of semiotics is the **sign**, i. e. something that has meaning to someone else, in some context. **symbol** is a type of sign, and a **pictogram** is a type of visual symbol, that could also be called an **icon**.

| section: Context is key

## Context is key

Symbols are always understood in some **context**. The symbol ‚ò†Ô∏è could refer to a dangerous area, a poisonous liquid, or a jolly pirate ship at a kid's birthday party.

Symbols can also mean different things to different people. Symbols are **conventional**, which mean that they are agreed upon to mean something, and not everyone may know all of these agreements. A kid may link the ‚ò†Ô∏è symbol to pirates of the Carribean, a doctor in a hospital to something else entirely.

</div>

---

| section: Form & Style

## Form or function?

The way a symbol is presented is also part of the context. Simple lines and bold swatches of color are usually more readable at a glance. Detailed drawings are more decorative, but don't convey information that easily. For that reason, different styles are used for different purposes - if the purpose is to convey important information quickly, then the symbol should be as simple (readable) as possible.

If the functionality of the symbol is not that important, or the main function of the symbol is to be decorative, then there is more room to experiment with the form - or how the symbol looks like.

-

---

## Style or substance?

Think and discuss - what are the things you need to pay attention to when designing a good icon? What are the dos and the don't-s?

To your right there are three sets of symbols, or icons, of different level of detail and style of drawing.
Try to think, in what context, and for what these could be used, and try to sketch the missing icon in the corresponding style.

When you have finished, click the button to reveal the original icon design and compare it to your result.

What is better in your design, what could still be improved?

# Back to tattooing

Tattoos have always had strong symbolic meaning - **cultural**, to convey some message about the bearer to other members of society - and / or **personal**, to mean something to the bearer herself.

What meaning or function whould your **smart tattoo** have? Would it be personal, functional or cultural? Does it have to be understood by everyone, at a glance? Or could it be secret and personal, only understood by the bearer?

Tattoos become blurry over time and lose their sharpness. Think about how you should design icons for tattoos to reduce these effects?

| section: Deciding the conditions

## Deciding the conditions

In theory, chemicals can be engineered to react to any type of a condition in human body and produce a color.
Decide with your pair a condition that would be important to make visible or measurable with a tattoo.
Justify your choice with arguments.
Write down the condition to a piece of paper.

1. the basics of icon design

2. the cultural context of the symbol

3. the specifics of the 'material'

4. the basic principles of pictography and icon design
