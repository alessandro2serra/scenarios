# What you will learn

<mark>TODO</mark> Address the student here (I moved the learning goals to teacher notes)

<f-notes>

# Learning goals

* To promote interest towards learning both design and STEM

* To support creativity by illustrating how ideas across different subjects feed each other 

* To learn about concepts in skin biology, indicator chemistry and icon design

</f-notes>

# Warming up with a pair

<span class="bullet">1</span>"Tattoo" what you soon hear by gently tapping images to your partner’s back.

<span class="bullet">2</span>Take a pen and paper. One of you writes than words that a designer might use to talk about tattoos. The other one writes down words that a scientist might use. Tap these images to your partners back. See if you can guess the words.

<span class="bullet">3</span>Discuss with a pair: what kind of concepts are easy to “guess” from limited information

# Prologue


Tattoos have been around since ancient times.

They are done by punctuating the skin with a needle that injects ink under the skin.

Now MIT-research group has suggested that some inks can be used to create smart tattoo’s that provide useful information for example about hydration, sugar and pH-levels. 

Work with your pair and design a “smart” tattoo

# What to measure?

*The MIT-researchers used inks that functioned as indicators. Indicators are chemical substances that change color according to changes in surrounding chemical concentrations.*

*In order to design a smart tattoo you need to figure out what type of biological substance you want to observe!*

Discuss with your pair what substances exist in human body and how do these influence human health. Choose which one you want to measure and why.
When you have decided open a paint and draw a quick black and white icon of what you want to measure.

# Tattoos are icons

The icons on the left  refer to certain reasons to have a tattoo. Can you guess the reason behind the icon? 
Visit the icon designer to learn more about icons and make adjustments to your icon if necessary

# Test your design


*There are biological and chemical factors that you might want to take into account in your smart tattoo design.

Compare the word lists you wrote  earlier and tape them into each other. Think and draw the possible connections between these words.

Test your design in smart tattoo simulator to explore further connections. Write these down as well.*

# Share your ideas

With the assistance of your paper share your ideas about your design and smart tattoos in general.

What are the critical scientific concepts a tattoo designer needs to bear in mind?
