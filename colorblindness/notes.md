- swap slides with v-if instead v-show
- gap, padding value?










- Teacher notes (similar solution to sidebar? using details for now)
- distinctive areas (icons, color?) for different parts ie teacher notes, assignments, tasks, theory etc 


- assign margins to components similar to position? mostly top and bottom and for f-next-button and f-hr

# So there we go

When talking about the effect of color, most people only think of its shade. Designing with color means designing with all three properties of color, which are **hue, saturation and brightness**.
All three of these properties change the effect the color has. 

#### Have a look at these 2 greens ðŸ‘‰

Both are greens, but they have different effects. Most people wouldnâ€™t call the right color natural although green often is used to suggest organic, natural themes. Therefore we have to look closely when working with colors and not only judge the colorâ€™s effect by its hue.
